#Problem Domain from Code Wars
"Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number."

I worked with Max Suman and we got help from Collin. We used MDN to look up string methods such as splice.
