## Description on Code Wars 
"Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

Good luck!"

I worked alone, but consulted Stack Overflow for how to alternate every other letter. I consulted MND for information on splitting and joining and used REPL.it to figure the problem out.
