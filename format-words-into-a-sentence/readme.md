#Problem Domain from Code Wars 
"Complete the method so that it formats the words into a single comma separated value. The last word should be separated by the word 'and' instead of a comma. The method takes in an array of strings and returns a single formatted string. Empty string values should be ignored. Empty arrays or null/nil values being passed into the method should result in an empty string being returned."
